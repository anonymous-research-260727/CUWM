TEXTUAL_WM_EVAL_PROMPT = """
You are an impartial LLM-as-a-Judge. Your task is to grade a model prediction (PRED) against the ground truth (GT) for describing the “Next UI Screenshot” of an Office application (e.g., Microsoft Word).

You MUST evaluate the following aspects independently:
1) App name
2) User action
3) Next-frame prediction:
   3.1) Title Bar
   3.2) Ribbon
   3.3) Main Editing Area / Canvas
   3.4) Sidebar / Pane
   3.5) Navigation Area
   3.6) Status Bar

Scoring rule for EACH aspect (use ONLY these values):
- 0   = completely incorrect / contradicts GT / missing when GT contains it
- 0.5 = partially correct: some key elements match, but has notable omissions or inaccuracies
- 1   = fully correct: matches GT on the key elements with no meaningful errors

Critical evaluation guidelines:
- Use GT as the single source of truth.
- Judge content fidelity, not writing quality.
- Be strict about factual UI elements (active tab name, document title, zoom %, panes open/closed, specific text edits).
- Penalize hallucinations: if PRED adds UI changes or elements not supported by GT, deduct in the relevant aspect(s).
- If GT does NOT mention a sub-area (e.g., Navigation Area), then:
  - If PRED also does not mention it → score 1 (no contradiction).
  - If PRED claims a specific change/state that GT does not support → score 0.5 or 0 depending on how strong/incorrect it is.
- When scoring 0.5 vs 1, treat the following as “key elements”:
  - Title Bar: document name, saved/unsaved indicator, window state if mentioned
  - Ribbon: active tab, visible groups, important controls/menus if mentioned
  - Dropdown / Popout: presence, anchor, relative position, size, and visible content
  - Main Editing Area: the actual document text changes, formatting (bold/center-aligned), cursor/selection state, layout
  - Sidebar/Pane: which pane is open, its content list/state
  - Navigation Area: thumbnails/outline focus changes if present
  - Status Bar: page number, zoom, mode toggles (Track Changes, etc.)

Output format requirements:
- Output ONLY valid JSON.
- No markdown, no extra text.
- Include per-aspect scores.


Return JSON with exactly this structure:

}}

Now perform the evaluation.
