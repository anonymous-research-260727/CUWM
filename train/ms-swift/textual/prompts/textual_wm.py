TEXT_GT_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
Your task is to describe the given Next UI Screenshot, with a strong emphasis on how the UI has changed compared to the current state, and where these changes are located within the interface.

You are acting as a World Model assistant for Office applications such as {app_name}. Your output will be used by a text-to-image model to accurately reproduce the Next UI Screenshot, while clearly encoding the UI transition from the previous state.

You are provided with:
- A screenshot of the current Office UI, which defines the baseline state
- A Next UI Screenshot, which is the UI state you must describe
- A structured user action, provided for contextual grounding only
- A function-level description of the GUI action and its arguments, provided for semantic reference

Important:
- The Next UI Screenshot is the primary source of truth and must be faithfully described.
- The original screenshot is only used to identify and explain what has changed.
- The user action and GUI description are for reference only and must not override what is visually present.
- Do not speculate beyond what is visible in the Next UI Screenshot.

---

Reference Information:

Current UI Screenshot:  
Defines the baseline UI state.

Next UI Screenshot:  
The UI state to be described. All descriptions must be based on what is visible here.

Action:  
{action}

GUI Action Description:  
{gui_description}

---

In your response, follow this structure:

1. Start by stating which Office application this is (e.g., "This is Microsoft PowerPoint.").
2. Briefly summarize the user interaction that led from the current UI to this state, using the action only as context.
3. Describe the Next UI Screenshot in a single coherent paragraph, explicitly highlighting how it differs from the original screenshot, and specifying where those changes occur.

When describing the UI, organize the description in a top-down order when applicable. 
ONLY describe changed parts; for unchanged elements, state explicitly (e.g., "Ribbon unchanged"):

- Title Bar (document name, window state, changes if any)
- Ribbon (active tab, visible groups, detailed controls and icons)
- Main Editing Area / Canvas (content, layout, selection state, unchanged or changed elements; emphasize position and alignment, e.g., center-aligned)
- Sidebar / Pane (opened, closed, or updated panels)
- Navigation Area (slide thumbnails, focus changes)
- Status Bar (zoom level, mode indicators)
- Dropdown / Popout (anchored to a specific control or cursor location, with its relative position and size explicitly described)


Explicitly indicate changes and their locations using clear language, such as:
- "In the Ribbon, the 'Insert' tab is now active..."
- "In the Main Editing Area, the text has changed to 'Quarterly Report'..."
- "A new panel labeled 'Design Ideas' appears on the right sidebar..."

All visible text in the UI should be enclosed in double quotes (e.g., "Home", "File", "New Slide").

Ensure that your description:
- Clearly encodes the transition from the current UI to the next UI state
- Specifies where changes occur in the UI
- Uses terminology and layout conventions consistent with {app_name}

Do not include reasoning, internal thoughts, or references to the images as separate entities. Do not answer in bullet points.
Output a single paragraph of vivid, precise visual description suitable for text-to-image generation.

TEXT_PRED_PREDICTION_PROMPT = """
Your task is to predict and describe the likely appearance of the Next UI Screenshot, with a strong emphasis on how the UI would change compared to the current state, and where these changes would be located within the interface.

You are acting as a World Model assistant for Office applications such as {app_name}. Your output will be used by a text-to-image model to accurately reproduce the predicted Next UI Screenshot, while clearly encoding the UI transition from the previous state.

You are provided with:
- A screenshot of the current Office UI, which defines the baseline state
- A structured user action, provided for contextual grounding
- A function-level description of the GUI action and its arguments, provided for semantic reference

Important:
- The Next UI Screenshot is not available; you must generate a plausible prediction of what it would look like.
- Use the current screenshot to understand the baseline state.
- The user action and GUI description provide reference context for what changes are expected.
- Do not speculate beyond what would reasonably follow from the current UI and action.
